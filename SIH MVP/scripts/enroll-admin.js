// Placeholder: Admin enrollment typically uses Fabric CA and stores identities in a wallet.
// For local testing, use the identities generated by fabric-samples/test-network with '-ca'.
// Implement enrollment as needed using 'fabric-network' and 'fabric-ca-client'.
console.log("Use identities from fabric-samples/test-network or implement CA enrollment here.");
